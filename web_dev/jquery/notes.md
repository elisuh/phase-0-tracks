# JQuery Plan of Attack
* I already know some jQuery so I feel like kind of an asshole writing this file. I haven't used it in a while, so I still need to study some.
* I will look at some of my old code.
* I will look at Mozilla Developers Network
* I will think about questions I want to ask in order to complete parts of my project that I'm not sure about doing (e.g. are there ways of duplicating one image using JS/jqeury?)
