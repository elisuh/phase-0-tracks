# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a project. They're useful for experimenting or trying things out without altering the master branch.

A commit is a save point for a project. A got commit message is detailed and explains what has been changed since the last commit.
