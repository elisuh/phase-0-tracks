<!-- 1. Semantic tags make a page more readable and accessible. They're usually invisible for most users but can be useful in page readers for the visually impaired. 2. HTML elements load from top to bottom in the order they appear. 3. I had no idea snippets could be made or edited. I'm not sure if I'd use this in the future since I want to learn by typing, but I probably will as the course progresses. 4. Creating snippets was a challenge for me because I was navigating and not driving, and I was unfamiliar with the concept so had to research while I directed. I'll have to try it on my own. -->
