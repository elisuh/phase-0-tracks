      In most federations, there are three lifts people must complete in a meet: squat, bench press and deadlift. In most meets, competitors get 3 attempts to do each lift, with their highest weight (given that the attempt is green-lit by the federation) contributing to their overall meet total. For each lift, there are commands a competitor must listen for when completing each lift.
