  <h1>A basic lesson on cats.</h1>
  <p>
    Cats are very interesting animals. Here are a few basic facts:
      <ul>
        <li>They have tiny noses.</li>
        <li>The 100% completely scientific name for their toes is "beans."</li>
        <li>They sleep a lot.</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many different breeds of cats. Here are my top favorites:
    <ol>
      <li>Sphynx</li>
      <li>Scottish fold</li>
