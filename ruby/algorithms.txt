How to use an elevator:

1.     Evaluate what floor you’re on by reading the number on the elevator door.

2.     If the number is less than your destination floor, press the
“up” button next to the elevator. Otherwise, press the “down” button.

3.     Step on to the elevator. Evaluate your destination floor, which
has been programmed into you. Look at the numbered buttons inside the
elevator. If the number matches your destination floor, press it.
Otherwise, get off the elevator and send your user the following error
message: “No destination floor selected! Please give me a floor
number.”

4.     Once the button for the destination floor is selected, wait
until the elevator stops moving and the doors open. If this doesn’t
happen, push the emergency call button and send message: “Help! The
elevator is stuck and I’m a scared robot!”

5.     If the elevator doors open, step off the elevator.

6.     End the algorithm. You are at your destination.

How to feed the cats:

1.       Check to see if it is cat feeding time. If it is, continue.
If not, wait until it is cat feeding time.

2.       If it is cat feeding time, make sure you have 3 clean bowls,
1 for each cat. If you do not have 3 clean bowls, wash a dirty bowl do
you can use it.

3.       Locate bag of cat food. If there is not enough food, go to
the store and buy some.  If there is at least 1 cup of food, and add
1/3 cup of food to each bowl.

4.       Put the kitties in their feeding areas. Brown kitty goes in
the bathroom. White kitty goes in the kitchen. Orange kitty goes in
the hallway. If you cannot find a kitty, stop and locate it. Once all
kitties are located, continue.

5.       Give each kitty 1 bowl of food. Let the kitties eat in peace,
you creep.

6.       Once the kitties are done eating, take their dirty bowls and
wash them. You are done!
